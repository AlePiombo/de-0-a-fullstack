These guidelines are designed with four core principles in mind, known as POUR.

P stands for Perceivable. Users must be able to perceive the information that you are presenting. For example, you can provide alternative text for images, so users who access your website with a screen reader can understand them.
O stands for Operable. Users must be able to interact with the user interface. For example, you can make sure that all functionality is accessible through the keyboard too, not just the mouse.
U stands for Understandable. Users must be able to understand the information. For example, you can avoid complex sentences and use simple language as much as possible.
R stands for Robust. A wide range of browsers and other tools, including assistive technologies, must be able to interpret the content.pagespeed.web.dev
